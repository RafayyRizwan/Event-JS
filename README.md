This project is a web application designed to collect and display user feedback on luxury brand products. Built with HTML and JavaScript, it features a form for users to input their name, age, email, job, designation, product type, and feedback. Upon submission, either by clicking the submit button or pressing the "Enter" key, the input data is displayed on the page, and a thank-you alert is shown. Event listeners ensure smooth user interaction. Future enhancements may include adding CSS for styling, implementing form validation, and integrating with a backend to store feedback data.
